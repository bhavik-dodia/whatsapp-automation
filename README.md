- Add chromedriver path to your environment variables ➕

- Install selenium using "pip install selenium" command 💻

- Create a new user profile in chrome and provide its path to user-data-dir in ChromeOptions so that it won't affect your main user profile and you need to scan the QR code only once. (Only add that path in whatsapp_automation.py file) 🙍‍♂️
